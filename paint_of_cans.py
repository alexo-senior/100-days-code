"""You are painting a wall. The instructions on the paint can says that 1 can of paint 
can cover 5 square meters of wall. Given a random height and width of wall, calculate 
how many cans of paint you'll need to buy.

number of cans = (wall height x wall width) Ã· coverage per can.

e.g. Height = 2, Width = 4, Coverage = 5

number of cans = (2 * 4) / 5
               = 1.6
But because you can't buy 0.6 of a can of paint,
the result should be rounded up to 2 cans.

IMPORTANT: Notice the name of the function and 
parameters must match those on line 13 for the code to work."""
